    <h2 class="title editable block">
<span class="title-prefix">12.1</span> Overview</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s01_p01">The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes significant new disclosure and corporate governance requirements for public companies and also provides for substantially increased liability under the federal securities laws for public companies and their executives and directors. After it was adopted, the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX adopted more comprehensive reporting requirements for listed companies, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a host of new regulations aimed a strengthening transparency and accountability through more timely and accurate disclosure of information about corporate performance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s01_p02">The most important changes concern director independence, the composition and responsibilities of the audit, nominating and compensation committees, shareholder approval of equity compensation plans, codes of ethics or conduct, the certification of financial statements by executives, payments to directors and officers of the corporation, the creation of an independent accounting oversight board, and the disclosure of internal controls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s02" condition="start-of-chunk" version="5.0" lang="en">
    <h2 class="title editable block">
<span class="title-prefix">12.2</span> Director Independence</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s02_p01">New stock exchange listing requirements stipulate that the majority of directors of public companies be “independent.”<span class="footnote" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-fn12_001">An exception is made for “controlled companies”—those for which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group, or other company.</span> The rules further state, “No director will qualify as independent unless the board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the listed company” and require companies to disclose determinations of independence in its annual proxy statement or, if the company does not file an annual proxy statement, in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s02_p02">The rationale for increasing independence was that shareholders, by virtue of their inability to directly monitor management behavior, rely on the board of directors to perform critical monitoring activities and that the board’s monitoring potential is reduced, or perhaps eliminated, when management itself effectively controls the actions of the board. Additionally, outside directors may lack independence through various affiliations with the company and may be inclined to support management’s decisions in hopes of retaining their relationship with the firm. Requiring a board to have a majority of independent directors therefore increases the quality of board oversight and lessens the possibility of damaging conflicts of interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s03" condition="start-of-chunk" version="5.0" lang="en">
    <h2 class="title editable block">
<span class="title-prefix">12.3</span> Audit Committees</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s03_p01">Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act directs the stock exchanges and NASDAQ to require listed companies to have an audit committee composed entirely of independent directors. Subsequent stock exchange and SEC amendments further strengthened this provision by requiring the following, among other things:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s03_l01">
        <li>Each member of the audit committee is financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted by the board in its business judgment, or will become financially literate within a reasonable period of time after his or her appointment to the audit committee.</li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">At least one member of the audit committee is a “financial expert,” defined as someone who has</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li>an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles;</li>
                <li>an ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals, and reserves;</li>
                <li>experience preparing, auditing, analyzing, or evaluating financial statements;</li>
                <li>an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting;</li>
                <li>an understanding of audit committee functions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The audit committee has a charter that addresses the committee’s purpose and sets forth the duties and responsibilities of the committee.</li>
        <li>The audit committee obtains and reviews an annual report by the independent auditor regarding the firm’s internal quality-control procedures, discusses the audited financial statements with the independent auditor and management, and reports regularly to the board of directors.</li>
        <li>The audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the outside auditors. Additionally, the outside auditors must report directly to the audit committee.</li>
        <li>The audit committee has the authority to engage independent counsel and other advisers, as it determines necessary to carry out its duties.</li>
        <li>The audit committee approves, in advance, any audit or nonaudit services provided by the outside auditors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s03_p02">The reasons behind these reforms are self-evident. Audit committees are in the best position within the company to identify and act in instances where top management may seek to misrepresent reported financial results. An audit committee composed entirely of outside independent directors can provide independent recommendations to the company’s board of directors. The responsibilities of the audit committee include review of the internal audit department, review of the annual audit plan, review of the annual reports and the results of the audit, selection and appointment of external auditors, and review of the internal accounting controls and safeguard of corporate assets.</p>

<div class="section" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s04" condition="start-of-chunk" version="5.0" lang="en">
    <h2 class="title editable block">
<span class="title-prefix">12.4</span> Compensation Committees</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s04_p01">New NYSE and SEC rules require that</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s04_l01">
        <li>listed companies have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors;</li>
        <li>the compensation committee has a written charter that addresses, among other things, the committee’s purpose and sets forth the duties and responsibilities of the committee;</li>
        <li>the compensation committee produces—on an annual basis—a compensation committee report on executive compensation, to be included in the company’s annual proxy statement or annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s04_p02">These reforms respond to the unprecedented growth in compensation for top executives and a dramatic increase in the ratio between the compensation of executives and their employees over the last 2 decades. A reasonable and fair compensation system for executives and employees is fundamental to the creation of long-term corporate value. The responsibility of the compensation committee is to evaluate and recommend the compensation of the firm’s top executive officers, including the CEO. To fulfill this responsibility objectively, it is necessary that the compensation committee be composed entirely of outside independent directors.</p>

    <h2 class="title editable block">
<span class="title-prefix">12.5</span> Nominating Committees</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s05_p01">New NYSE and SEC rules stipulate that</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s05_l01">
        <li>a listed company must have a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors;</li>
        <li>the nominating and corporate governance committee must have a charter that addresses the committee’s purpose and sets forth the goals and responsibilities of the committee.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s05_p02">Nominating new board members is one of the board’s most important functions. It is the responsibility of the nominating committee to nominate individuals to serve on the company’s board of directors. Placing this responsibility in the hands of an independent nominating committee increases the likelihood that chosen individuals will be more willing to act as advocates for the shareholders and other stakeholders and be less beholden to management.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">12.6</span> Shareholder Approval for Equity-Compensation Plans</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s06_p01">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">equity-compensation plan</a><span class="glossdef">A plan or other arrangement that provides for the delivery of equity securities, including options, of the listed company to any service provider as compensation for services.</span></span> is a plan or other arrangement that provides for the delivery of equity securities (including options) of the listed company to any service provider as compensation for services. Equity-compensation plans can help align shareholder and management interests, and equity-based awards are often very important components of employee compensation. New NYSE and SEC rules require shareholder approval for stock option plans or other equity compensation plans and any material modification of such plans. These rules are subject to a significant number of exemptions, however. Separately, new accounting rules have changed the accounting of stock options.<span class="footnote" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-fn12_002">For more on this subject, see <a class="xref" href="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch08#dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "CEO Performance Evaluation and Executive Compensation"</a> in this volume.</span></p>

<span class="title-prefix">12.7</span> Codes of Ethics and Conduct</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch12appA_s07_p01">New rules also require that public companies must adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers, and employees; include its code of business conduct and ethics on its Web site; and each annual report filed with the SEC must state that the code of business conduct and ethics is available on the Web site. The code of conduct must comply with the definition of a “code of ethics” set forth in section 406 of Sarbanes-Oxley and provide for an enforcement mechanism that ensures prompt and consistent enforcement of the code, protection for persons reporting questionable behavior, clear and objective standards for compliance, and a fair process by which to determine violations.</p>
