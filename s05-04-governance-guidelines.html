<span class="title-prefix">3.4</span> Governance Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch03_s04_p01">As part of the recent wave of governance reforms, the NYSE adopted new rules that require companies to adopt and publicly disclose their corporate governance policies. Specifically, the following subjects must be addressed in the guidelines:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch03_s04_l01">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Director qualification standards</em>. These standards, in addition to requiring independence, may also address other substantive qualification requirements, including policies limiting the number of boards on which a director may sit and director tenure, retirement, and succession.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Director responsibilities</em>. These responsibilities should clearly articulate what is expected from a director, including basic duties and responsibilities with respect to attendance at board meetings and advance review of meeting materials.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Director access to management and, as necessary and appropriate, to an independent advisor</em>. Clear policies should be adopted that define protocols for director access to corporate managers and identify situations when the board should retain external advisors.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Director compensation</em>. Director compensation guidelines should include general principles for determining the form and amount of director compensation (and for reviewing those principles, as appropriate).</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Director orientation and continuing education</em>. Director orientation and continuing education should be the responsibility of the governance committee, if one exists. If the board does not have a separate governance committee, the full board, the nominating committee, or both, should have this responsibility.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Management succession</em>. Succession planning should include policies and principles for CEO selection and performance review, as well as policies regarding succession in the event of an emergency or the retirement of the CEO.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Annual performance evaluation of the board</em>. The board should conduct a self-evaluation at least annually to determine whether it and its committees and their individual directors are functioning effectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="dekluyvercorpgov_1.0-ch03_s04_p02">Best practice suggests that the board should review the guidelines at least annually. By elaborating on the board’s and directors’ basic duties, a carefully constructed set of governance guidelines will help both the board and individual directors understand their obligations and the general boundaries within which they will operate.</p>
